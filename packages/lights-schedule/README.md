# Lights Schedule

City lights schedule provider.

Right now these cities are supported:

- Saint-Petersburg, Russia;
- Moscow, Russia;

## Schedule schema

```ts
export interface CityLightsSchedule {
	year: number;
	city: LightsCity;
	schedule: number[];
	getter: (date: Date) => number;
}
```

The `schema` is an array of integer values where each 4 numbers represent a schedule data for a specific day as:

```js
[
	hours_on, minutes_on, hours_off, minutes_off, // 1st Jan
	hours_on, minutes_on, hours_off, minutes_off, // 2nd Jan
	hours_on, minutes_on, hours_off, minutes_off, // 3rd Jan
	...
]
```

The `getter` is a function that returns the first index of these 4 indices for a given date.

### The reasoning

*Why the schedule is just an array and not 2D array?*

That's to save some space. As we know that each day schedule represents a tuple of 4 entries, it does not complicates a code too much.

*Why do we need a getter?*

The main reason is â€” to save some space. The schedule data varies from city to city. In some cities the schedule changes every day, in others every several days.

## API

To create a provider, use a constructor function and pass a supported city as the only parameter:

```ts
import { initLightsProvider } from "lights-schedule";

const provider = initLightsProvider("moscow");
```

The provider exposes the information and methods to work with schedule data:

```ts
interface LightsProvider {
	city: LightsCity;
	getEventsByDate: (input?: Date) => LightsEvent[];
	getScheduleByDate: (input?: Date) => LightsSchedule;
	getStateByDate: (input?: Date) => IlluminationState;
	year: number;
}
```

### `getScheduleByDate(input?: Date): LightsEvent[]`

Returns the lights schedule for a given date.

```ts
import { initLightsProvider } from "lights-schedule";

interface LightsSchedule {
	duration: number;
	LIGHTS_START: number;
	LIGHTS_END: number;
}

const { getScheduleByDate } = initLightsProvider("moscow");
const schedule = getScheduleByDate();
```

### `getStateByDate(input?: Date): IlluminationState`

Returns the state for current moment and a time till the next event.

```ts
import { initLightsProvider } from "lights-schedule";

type LightsEventName =
	| "LIGHTS_START"
	| "LIGHTS_END";

interface IlluminationState {
	lights: boolean;
	event: LightsEventName;
	timestamp: number;
}

const { getStateByDate } = initLightsProvider("moscow");
const state = getStateByDate();
```

### `getEventsByDate(input: Date = new Date()): LightsEvent[]`

Returns all the lights schedule events for a given date.

```ts
import { initLightsProvider } from "lights-schedule";

const { getEventsByDate } = initLightsProvider("moscow");
const events = getEventsByDate();
```

## Cities

### Saint-Petersburg, Russia

[Schedule source][lights-schedule-source-spb]

Illumination schedule for Saint-Petersburg, Russia has some repetitive structure, that will be used to *compress* the data.

What can be noticed is that the schedule changes every 5 days. Each month has the same date-ranges with the same schedule: 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, 26-.... This way each month is broken into 6 parts and we can get the right part by division by 5 (31 should be handled).

All the data is represented as an array with repetitive data as `[ ..., hours_on, minutes_on, hours_off, minutes_off, ... ]`, where the time range is stored.

So, how do we get the right data?

1. Imagine that every 4 items makes a new row;
2. The dataset has 6 rows for each month. The month number can give us the starting row as `(month * 6 - 6)` (taking 0-index into account);
3. The date should give as the offset required to get to the right row as `min((date - 1) // 5, 5)`, where `//` is integer division and `min` function used as the last range can be `26-31` for example;
4. As there are not real rows, we get the "imaginary" row using the fact that there are 4 items per collection we get index as such `row => row * 4`, and the next four items is the data we need.

Overall:

```ts
function getSchedule(month: number, date: number, data: number[]): number[] {
	const row = (month * 6 - 6) + Math.min(Math.floor((date - 1) / 5), 5);
	const index = row * 4;
	return data.slice(index, index + 4);
}
```
