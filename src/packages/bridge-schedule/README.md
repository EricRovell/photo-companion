```ts
import { isNavigationTime } from "bridges-schedule";

const check = isNavigationTime();
```

### `getNavigationState(date?: Date): { navigation: boolean, days: number }`

Returns a navigation state for a given date: is navigation is open and how many days there are till the navigation opens or closed. The current date is used as fallback.

```ts
import { getNavigationState } from "bridge-schedule";

const state = getNavigationState();
```

### `getBridgeState(name: BridgeName, date?: Date, ignoreNavigationSchedule?: true): BridgeState;`

Returns a bridge state by a given date. The navigation period is taken into account.

`ignoreNavigationSchedule` option let's the function ignore the navigation period as if the bridges were operational throughout the year.

```

### `getNextBridgeEvent(date?): BridgeState`

Returns the closest bridge event from the given date. The current date is used as fallback.

```ts
import { getNextBridgeEvent } from "bridge-schedule";

interface BridgeState {
	name: BridgeName;
	open: boolean;
	timestamp: number;
}

const event = getNextBridgeEvent();
```

### `function getBridgeEvents(date?): BridgeEvent[]`

Returns all bridge events occurred at the given date. The current date used as fallback.

const events = getBridgeEvents();
```

### `isAllBridgesLiftedDown(date?: DateLike, ignoreNavigation? = false): boolean`

Returns a boolean indicating whether all the drawbridges are lifted down for a specific time.

```ts
import { isAllBridgesLiftedDown } from "bridge-schedule";

const isLiftedDownNow = isisAllBridgesLiftedDown();
const isLiftedDown = isisAllBridgesLiftedDown(new Date(2021, 7, 21));
```

### `isBridgeException(name: BridgeName): boolean`

Some drawbridges has non-permanent schedule. The `isBridgeException` provides a way to check is the given bridge should be considered as such an exception.
